        <h2> About me :</h2>
        <p>My name is Mostafa Mohamed Mahmoud. I graduated from the College of Computers and Information at Assiut University with good grades and an ETA graduation project with honors.
             Then I joined the military as an officer for two years and I was in charge of the electronic warfare system at the department. I love sports, especially football, and I'm a fan of the Barcelona Club, and I finally aspire to be a professional programmer, and to develop a lot, thanks.</p>
               <div>
                I owe a great deal to the following reviewers who patiently read each page of every chapter of
                the current version and made critical comments to improve on the book: Stefano Basagni, 
                Northeastern University and Roman Tankelevich, Colorado School of Mines. Additionally, I
                express thanks to the reviewers of the proposal package: Ted Krovetz, California State
                University; Kenneth Lambert, Washington and Lee University; Stephen Scott, University
                of Nebraska; and Deborah Silver, Rutgers, <div>The State University of New Jersey. The
                reviewers will recognize that their criticisms have not been overlooked, adding meaningfully
                to the quality of the finished book. Next, I express thanks to Amy Jollymore, Acquisitions
                Editor, for recognizing the importance and uniqueness of this project. All this would not have
                been possible without the careful planning of Product Manager Alyssa Pratt. I extend my
                sincere thanks to Alyssa, as well as to Content Project Manager Heather Furrow. I also thank
Tintu Thomas of Integra Software Services for</div> assisting us in keeping the project on schedule.
I would like to thank Chris Scriver and Serge Palladino of QA department of Cengage
Learning for patiently and carefully proofreading the text, testing the code, and discovering
typos and errors.
I am thankful to my parents, to whom this book is dedicated, for their blessings. Finally, I
would like to thank my wife Sadhana and my daughter Shelly. They cheered me up whenever
I was overwhelmed during the writing of this book.
I welcome any comments concerning the text. Comments may be forwarded to the following
                     <div>Recall that when a variable is passed by value, the formal parameter copies the value
of the actual parameter. That is, memory to copy the value of the actual parameter
is allocated for the formal parameter. As a parameter, a class object can be passed
by value.
Suppose that a class has several instance variables requiring a large amount of memory to
store data, and you need to pass a variable by value. The corresponding formal parameter
then receives a copy of the data of the variable. That is, the compiler must allocate
memory for the formal parameter, so as to copy the value of the instance variables of the
actual parameter. This operation might require, in addition to a large amount of storage
space, a considerable amount of computer time to copy the value of the actual parameter
into the formal parameter.
On the other hand, if a variable is passed by reference, the formal parameter receives only
the address of the actual parameter. Therefore, an efficient way to pass a variable as a
parameter is by reference. If a variable is passed by reference, then when the formal
parameter changes, the actual parameter also changes. Sometimes, however, you do not
want the function to be able to change the values of the instance variables. In C++, you
can pass a variable by reference and still prevent the function from changing its value by
using the keyword const in the formal parameter declaration. As an example, consider
the following function definition:</div>
